/**
 * The actual attempt at Tic Tac Toe Board reading.
 *
 * The Idea:
 *  - when the cam has been set up, grab a frame (or if more finesse is
 *  preferred, a bunch of frame and choose best / average) and find the tic tac
 *  toe board
 *  - by 'find' we mean: determine the outer lines of the box
 *  - then recognize the box: find / try to fit the inner lines (= that divide
 *  the board box in to cells) and thus find the board cells
 *  - game hasn't started yet, so the cells are *empty*; their current contents
 *  are thus background noise
 *  - now we're ready for the main 'reading' part itself:
 *  - when the Game is waiting for the player input, start:
 *  - the loop: compare if there has been a significant change in the contents of
 *  any cell relative to all other cells; if such a change seems to persist,
 *  most likely that means a X/O mark has been drawn in that cell
 *  - when there's significant disturbance (human player's hand / pen, Penbot
 *  is on the board drawing its own mark, etc), discard the webcam input
 *  - a) do not confuse the human opponent's and Penbot's marks! or
 *  - b) report all new drawn marks, it's not BoardReader's job to determine
 *  whose they are (the game knows whose turn it is anyway, so it can infer who
 *  did draw it)
 *
 * TODO: when able to read the board, combine this project with the Game
